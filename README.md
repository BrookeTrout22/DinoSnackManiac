Other
This project was originally forked from the phaser-es6-webpack project. It was then converted to a template project with comments and examples that are relevant to the GDD 325 course. It was then further modified by HomeMaid Studios, students of GDD 325, to become Butler Bot.

Known Bugs
For unknown reasons, the player occasionally falls through the floor in all levels. Refresh the webpage to fix.
In the living room, pulling the plant sometimes causes the player to fling out of the screen. Exit the level and return to fix.
